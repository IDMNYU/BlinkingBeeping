  * Using a motor (this could be your servo, or a brushed DC motor, or a stepper) or solenoid, create a system that moves to convey information - an indicator, or for responsove behavior. This could be a puppet, a sound maker, a geared system, or some other phsical device. Challenge yourself - can you control a system from a web interface, or can you have this system respond to an input of some sort? Document this on your blog.
