## Motors 
Fancy electromagnets that spin.
### brushless & brushed DC motors
The DC brush motor is one of the simplest motors in use today. You can find these motors just about anywhere. They are in household appliances, toys, and automobiles. Being simple to construct and control, these motors are the go-to solution for professionals and hobbyists alike.
### steppers
### servos
### Solenoids
linear actuators that operate along the same principles as motors.
### Relays
a relay uses an electromagnet to open or close a switch. They make really fun clicking noises and are often used to control high voltage/high current circuits from a smaller, safer one
### Transistors
solid state switches used to amplify signals and power
### Diodes
polarized components that make sure electricity only flows in one direction. useful in AC circuits, or in DC circuits when using an inductive load like a motor
### Bench power supply
