# Week 4 - Monday Sept 23 & Wed Sept 25

## Monday
* check out your switches
* [Arduino IDE, board definitions](week4.md)
* [Digital Out, what's the deal with all those pins anyhow?](week4.md)
* **For Wednesday 9/25**
* Readings- 
  * [Read Prologue and Chapter 1, _Attractive Things Work Better_ from "Emotional Design" by Don Norman](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=876410&ppg=16)
  * What do you think of the three elements of design (visceral, behavorial, and reflective) Norman describes? Are they sufficient? Is it too much hair splitting? Write a brief entry in your blog on these.

## Wednesday
* Example of a research presentaion
* [Digital Output](week4.md)
* Blink without delay
* **For Monday 10/2**
  * Expand on the interaction from your switches from last week. Now that you can control more than one light and have different switches control different behaviors, combine your two switches into one system, or create a system that has multiple digital inputs and outputs. How can you make this more attractive to a user? Document your work on your blog.
