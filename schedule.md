# [Week 1 - Wed September 6](week1.md)
* Class introductions
* Ritual reading of the syllabus
* [Jim Campbell's formula for computer art](https://www.jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/miscellaneous_references/)
* Readings
  * [Chris Crawford, Chapter 1 What is Interactivity? from "The Art of Interactive Design"](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=273475&ppg=25)
* Assignment
  * Start a blog or website for the course. Post a link in the class slack.
  * _Due Sunday September 11 by 5pm_ On your website, write a short response to the readings (between 200-500 words). Following Crawford's argument of interaction as something that exists along a continuium, how do you define interactivity? Do you agree with his definition? 
  * get trained in the IDM Design Lab and the Makerspace.

# Week 2 - Monday September 11 & Wednesday September 13
* Electricity basics
* your first build- [Atari punk console](/week1/apc.md)
* Some basics about parts
* [buttons and switches](switches.md)
* multimeters and other tools
* Readings- 
  * [Read Ch 1, _A History of Interaction_ from "Where the Action is" by Paul Dourish](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5966349&ppg=14)
  * [Everything you never wanted to know about switches](switches.md)
  * Dourish writes about a history of embodied interaction. He defines two separate threads that lead to this: _social_ and _tangible_ computing. How do you understand these terms based on the reading? Do you agree with his definitions? Do you think there are other kinds of computing he is ignoring?
* Assignment
  * Make a switch that you can control without using your hands. Document it on your site with a blog post. Write about what you are acomplishing here with this new kind of switch. Save this for next week, you'll use it again!
  * [Download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
  * [Sign up for presentations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u0xoj2lZ_zM9WBcj3Ap5-4PgslzUylcX95YNGhgqfe8/edit?usp=sharing)

# Week 3 - Monday September 18 & Wednesday September 20
* Let's see those switches
* Hello World of microcontrollers
* digital input and output
* Readings- 
  * [Read Prologue and Chapter 1, _Attractive Things Work Better_ from "Emotional Design" by Don Norman](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=876410&ppg=16)
  * What do you think of the three elements of design (visceral, behavorial, and reflective) Norman describes? Are they sufficient? Is it too much hair splitting? Write a short response on your class journal before Thursday Feb 20 at 6pm.
* Assignment
  * Using the switch you built last week, control a set of lights with your microcontroller. Try making a counter, or a stop light, or something else with this new control. Can you add more switches? Can you make lights blink independently (look at the Arduino examples > Digital > Blink without delay sketch for a hint on how to do this)? Document this new interaction with your switch and post it to your blog before class on Friday.

# Week 4 - Monday September 25 & Wednesday September 27
* Presentations!
* discussion of reading
* Show your work
* analog input and output
* Midterm party
  * Your midterm project is a group project. You will work in pairs. You need to build a physically interactive system that has some sort of physical input and output. There are a number of different ways this project can be approached, we will discuss in class. You will have a few weeks to build this, but every week in the process you are expected to show steady progress in its completion. While only one member of a group needs to write about the project, the other needs to link to the post from their site. You will present these in class, they should be functional and usable by other members of the class when you present the project. Hide the wires and breadboard and electronis as much as possible inside an enclosure, you want this to be presentable. Document your work well. If your presentation fails, you should still be able to show a working project through clear video documentation.
* Readings- 
  * [Phsyical Computing's Greatest Hits and Misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)
  * [A Taxonomy of Tangible User interfaces](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i262/f13/readings_pdf/taxonomy.pdf)
* Assignment
  * Build a love machine that identifies how compatible two people are with the microcontroller. Use analog sensors for this. Ideally, work in pairs. Document this in your journal.
  * Write a short decription of your midterm idea. Draw a sketch of what the system will be, think about how someone will interact with it. Be prepared to discuss your proposal next week in class. 


# Week 5 - Monday October 2 & Wed October 4
* Presentations!
* show your work
* midterm check in
* servos, sounds, and other things
  * silly scopes
  * resistor ladders
  * knock sensors
* Assignment
  * Work with your partner and complete your midterm project. Be prepared to show it in class next week. On one of your journals document the project- this includes (at least) a description of the project- a "what and why", how it works- a technical description or "how", what you could do to improve on this in the future, and a video or photos of it working. You will all present these in class next week.

# Week 6 - Tuesday October 10 & Wed October 11
* Midterm Presentations!
* Serial Examples
* Assignments
  * Take home quiz
  * Observation Project.
 
# Week 7 - Monday October 16 & Wednesday October 18
* Presentations!
* BLE and internal sensors
* Assignment
  * Observation Assignment - rethinking a physical interface.

# Week 8 - Monday October 23 & Wednesday October 25
* Presentations!
* Observation assignment results
* Other communication protocols - SPI / I2C
* Assignment
  * Create a sketch in the program of your choice that communicates with your microcontroller. Post a video of this on your blog. What are you making?
 
# Week 9 - Monday October 30 & Wednesday November 1
* presentations
* lots of lights with LEDs
* assignment - Make something with LED strips. This can be reactive to a sensor, or a standalone piece. Document it on your website.

# Week 10 - Monday November 6 & Wednesday November 8
* presentations
* Microcontrollers and the internet
* Assignment - Pull data from a public API and use that as a method to change soemthing with your microcontroller - a Servo, an LED, etc. Think about how this augments and changes your understanding of the data. Document your project and write about it. 
* Final project proposals - Come up with a proposal for what you would like to do for a final project.
