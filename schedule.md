# [Week 1 - Friday January 31](week1.md)
* Class introductions
* Ritual reading of the syllabus
* [Jim Campbell's formula for computer art](https://www.jimcampbell.tv/portfolio/miscellaneous_references/)
* Some basics about parts
* your first build- [555 flasher](/week1/apc.md)
* Readings
  * [Bret Victor "A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design"](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/) and [the follow-up to reader's responses](http://worrydream.com/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign/responses.html)
  * [Chris Crawford, Chapter 1 What is Interactivity? from "The Art of Interactive Design"](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=273475&ppg=25)
* Assignment
  * Start a blog or website for the course. Email me the link before class next week.
  * _Due Thurs Feb 6 by 5pm_ On your website, write a short response to the readings (between 200-500 words). Following Crawford's argument of interaction as something that exists along a continuium, how do you define interactivity? Do you agree with his definition? How does this relate to Victor's 'rant' about interfaces?
  * buy the parts for class and bring them with you next week
  * get trained in the Makerspace

# [Week 2 - Friday February 7](week2.md)
* Electricity basics
* [buttons and switches](switches.md)
* multimeters and other tools
* Readings- 
  * [Read Ch 1, _A History of Interaction_ from "Where the Action is" by Paul Dourish](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5966349&ppg=14)
  * [Everything you never wanted to know about switches](switches.md)
  * Dourish writes about a history of embodied interaction. He defines two separate threads that lead to this: _social_ and _tangible_ computing. How do you understand these terms based on the reading? Do you agree with his definitions? Do you think there are other kinds of computing he is ignoring?
* Assignment
  * Make a switch that you can control without using your hands. Document it on your site with a blog post. Write about what you are acomplishing here with this new kind of switch. Save this for next week, you'll use it again!
  * [Download the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

# [Week 3 - Friday February 14](week3.md)
* Let's see those switches
* [Sign up for presentations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MMgeDywQdWfN6e-FvFUnoKXYQhVwJvkjrlulPLM4cQc/edit?usp=sharing)
* Hello World of microcontrollers
* digital input and output
* Readings- 
  * [Read Prologue and Chapter 1, _Attractive Things Work Better_ from "Emotional Design" by Don Norman](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=876410&ppg=16)
  * What do you think of the three elements of design (visceral, behavorial, and reflective) Norman describes? Are they sufficient? Is it too much hair splitting? Write a short response on your class journal before Thursday Feb 20 at 6pm.
* Assignment
  * Using the switch you built last week, control a set of lights with your microcontroller. Try making a counter, or a stop light, or something else with this new control. Can you add more switches? Can you make lights blink independently (look at the Arduino examples > Digital > Blink without delay sketch for a hint on how to do this)? Document this new interaction with your switch and post it to your blog before class on Friday.

# Week 4 - Friday February 21
* Presentations!
* discussion of reading
* Show your work
* analog input and output
* Midterm party
  * Your midterm project is a group project. You will work in pairs. You need to build a physically interactive system that has some sort of physical input and output. There are a number of different ways this project can be approached, we will discuss in class. You will have a few weeks to build this, but every week in the process you are expected to show steady progress in its completion. While only one member of a group needs to write about the project, the other needs to link to the post from their site. You will present these in class, they should be functional and usable by other members of the class when you present the project. Hide the wires and breadboard and electronis as much as possible inside an enclosure, you want this to be presentable. Document your work well. If your presentation fails, you should still be able to show a working project through clear video documentation.
* Readings- 
  * [Phsyical Computing's Greatest Hits and Misses](https://www.tigoe.com/blog/category/physicalcomputing/176/)
  * [A Taxonomy of Tangible User interfaces](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i262/f13/readings_pdf/taxonomy.pdf)
* Assignment
  * Build a love machine that identifies how compatible two people are with the microcontroller. Use analog sensors for this. Ideally, work in pairs. Document this in your journal.
  * Write a short decription of your midterm idea. Draw a sketch of what the system will be, think about how someone will interact with it. Be prepared to discuss your proposal next week in class.
