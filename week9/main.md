Or use an LED matrix. Blind us. What are the frustrations, what are the joys of working with these devices? Post a video to your class site. Some suggestions include leveraging Josef Albers exercises listed here : https://aaeportal.com/?id=-20314 . Mirrors, glass, and other reflective surfaces may be helpful in this exercise.
