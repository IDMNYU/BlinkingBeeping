# LEDs and blinky things
## Light Emittinbg Diodes
A diode is a kind of electonic component that only allows electricity to flow in one drection. An LED is a diode that lights up when there is a voltage difference across its anode and cathode pins.

## LED basics
### Colors
There are a bunch of 'standard' LED colors, soem that are rarer, adn some that mix together really nicely. The color is made by either 1) the chemical compound on the substrate of the diode, 2) the clolor of the plastic shell around the electric compoents, 3) color mixing of several dies in one element.
The color of an LED will be centered on one wavelength, which is always going to be determined by the chemicals and the casing. 

### Uses
LEDs are used for illumination and indication. Illumination would be a flashlight or headlights on a car. Inbdication would be a status light of some sort.

### Powering
While LEDs require voltage to drive them, it's the amount of current going through them that determines how bright they will be. However, there is a minimum voltage that needs to be overcome
