# LEDs 
Some of you asked about LEDs, and a video would be a hard thing to put together because there's just a load of things to talk about. I can start an LED channel. What might be more ueful is to document some ways all of you can use LEDs, some various tips for thinking abotu their use, and show some stuff I think is fairly inspiring.

## Material aspects of LEDs
Every LED element has a specifc color. Unlike incandescent lightbulbs (the ones with filaments, also called Edison bulbs), LEDs only operate in a specific wavelength. So you may find reds at 630 nm, greens at 530 nm, and blues at 450 nm. White LEDs are often a blue LED with a yellow coating. This is important to remember when working with lights because often mixing won't produce the exact color you're looking for. A RGB LED often won't make a clean white, but have a purple-ish or greenish tinge. There are now RGBW (red green blue white) LEDs that make for a fuller color spectrum, and in theatrical lighting it's not uncommon to find RGBA (red green blue amber). 

LEDs have some narrow viewing angles. That is, they don't illuminate a space, or glow particularly well. This is due to a nmber of factors, but a lot of it has to do with the intended application of the lights. an indicator may have a wide angle, whereas something that would be used for illumination may be narrower so it can be angled in a particular fashion.

## Ways of working with LEDs as objects
Usually, the way that people most want to work with LEDs is to diffuse light, or make it softer. There are a bunch of way to do this, these are just a few I've tried that have worked well for me.
* hot glue melted over the bulb - when it dried it helps diffuse the light
* sanding the bulb - a fien grit sandpaper on a clar domed LED wil help diffuse the light
* ping pong balls - they will glow super nicely. Poke a hole in a ping pong ball with a pencil and pop it on top of a 5mm domes LED (those are the kinds of LEDs we were using in class prior to the neopixels)
* paper or other semi-translucent material - vellum, rice paper, etc. held at a distance from a LED will help diffuse the light. Put it in a frame and you have a [contemporary art piece](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/117948?sov_referrer=artist&artist_id=34787&page=1)

Looking at bright LED lights directly is a sure fire way to blind yourself. Also, we generally don't want to look at points of light because it can be dul. Often lookig at the reflection of some light, light that bounces off of another object, or one that creates a shadow is more compelling than something head on. Many of the examples I'm going to show in a second fly in the face of that, but I still think it's true :)

## Ways of working with LEDs as outputs
You've used LEDs as indicators - turning on to let a user know that something is happening, varying brightness when a sensor is used, maybe playing a pattern. But they can be thought of as more than just a 'press the button see it turn on' demo. While at the end of the day it's just excited electrons moving across a chemical substrate, the information that determines the pathways of ther electrons has meaning. 

LEDs can be used as theatrical lighting, [architectural](https://www.architecturalrecord.com/articles/7785-cond-nast-s---third-avenue-cafeteria) [spaces](https://vimeo.com/172745960), for [media art installations](http://www.paramedia.net), [groovy 70s sci fi backgrounds](https://www.retrozap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/SciFiSat_048.jpg), indicators, even [interfaces themselves](https://cs.nyu.edu/~jhan/ledtouch/ledtouch.mpg).

## projects with LEDs
There are a number of artists and designers who work with LEDs, there's no space for all of them - these are a couple of folks and projects that I realy dig:
* [Leo Villareal](http://villareal.net) - a contemporary artist who works with dynamic light. Best known for [lightng up the Bay Bridge in San Francisco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vsF5wnJpmw) and the [Thames in London](http://villareal.net/illuminated-river)
* [Erwin Redl](http://paramedia.net) - works primarly with static light installations
* [Jim Campbell](http://jimcampbell.tv) - MIT enginerr turned artist, much of his work is abotu memory
* [Chika](http://imagima.com) - a VJ turned installation artist, Chika uses projecion mapping tools to control minimal light sculptures
* [James CLar](https://www.jamesclar.com) - works with many different kinds of lights, often uses LEDs as a backlight for gels and prints
* [United Visual Artists](https://www.uva.co.uk) - London based group who have made a [number of](https://www.uva.co.uk/features/array) [sublime](https://www.uva.co.uk/features/new-dawn) [LED based works](https://www.uva.co.uk/features/continuum)
