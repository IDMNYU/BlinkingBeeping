## Midterm Project

* Your midterm project is a group project. You will work in pairs. You need to build a physically interactive system that has some sort of physical input and output. There are a number of different ways this project can be approached, we will discuss it in class. You will have 2 weeks to build this, but each week in the process you are expected to show steady progress in its completion. While only one member of a group needs to write about the project in their class blog, the other needs to link to the post from their site. You will present these in class, they should be functional and usable by other members of the class when you present the project. Hide the wires and breadboard and electronics as much as possible inside an enclosure, you want this to be presentable. Document your work well. If your presentation fails in class, you should still be able to show a working project through clear video documentation.
