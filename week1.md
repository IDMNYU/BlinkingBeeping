  * _Due Sunday September 11 by 5pm_ On your website, write a short response to the readings (between 200-500 words). Following Crawford's argument of interaction as something that exists along a continuium, how do you define interactivity? Do you agree with his definition? Why might it be useful to have different kinds of ways of explaining how things work or interacting with doifferent systems?
