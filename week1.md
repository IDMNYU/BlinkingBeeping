# Week 1 - September 6
* Class introductions
* Ritual reading of the syllabus
* link to slides from class forthcoming
* the breadboard
* circuit schematics
* making your own switch
* Readings
  * [Chris Crawford, Chapter 1 What is Interactivity? from "The Art of Interactive Design"](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=273475&ppg=25)
  * [my notes on electricity](/week1/notes.md)
* Assignments
  * Start a blog or website for the course. Send me a link to your site.
  * _Due Friday September 13 by 10am_ On your website, write a short response to the readings (between 200-350 words). Following Crawford's argument of interaction as something that exists along a continuum, how do you define interactivity? Do you agree with his definition? Why might it be useful to have different kinds of ways of explaining how things work or interacting with different systems?
  * sign up to get trained in the [IDM Design Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/idmtech/) and the [Makerspace](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training-and-reservations/). 
  * [sign up for presentations in pairs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u0xoj2lZ_zM9WBcj3Ap5-4PgslzUylcX95YNGhgqfe8/edit?usp=sharing)
  * On paper, sketch out an imagined switch that controls a system (represented by an LED turining on or off). Make a circuit that realizes this sketch. What does this indicate? How is the action of using the switch relate to the light turining on? Clearly document your switch with video and post the sketch and video on your class journal. Now do it again, building a totally differrent switch that indicates something else. Document this and post it to your site. Write a brief description of how each works, what the light signifies, and how the input relates to the output. Bring at least one of these switches to class. You may work in pairs on this project. If you do work in pairs, make the same post on each documentation site.
