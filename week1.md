  * Start a blog or website for the course. Send me a link to your site.
  * _Due Sunday September 11 by 5pm_ On your website, write a short response to the readings (between 200-350 words). Following Crawford's argument of interaction as something that exists along a continuum, how do you define interactivity? Do you agree with his definition? Why might it be useful to have different kinds of ways of explaining how things work or interacting with different systems?
  * sign up to get trained in the [IDM Design Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/idmtech/design/) and the [Makerspace](http://makerspace.engineering.nyu.edu/training-and-reservations/). These may not be ready this week - the Makerspace orientations begin on September 11, so be sure to follow up with them.
