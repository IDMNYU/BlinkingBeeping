* Assignments
  * Observation Project - Pick a piece of interactive technology that is used in public, used by multiple people (so like, a phone doesn't count because it's only used by one person at a time). Write down your assumptions as to how it's used, and describe the context in which it's being used. Watch people use it, preferably without them knowing they're being observed. Take notes on how they use it, what they do differently, what appear to be the difficulties, what appear to be the easiest parts. Record what takes the longest, what takes the least amount of time, and how long the whole transaction takes. Write the report in your blog.
  * Reading [How to use a digital oscilloscope](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-an-oscilloscope/all)
  * Midterm review survey - [fill out this questionnaire](https://forms.gle/ZXGxDvrupSSL5oVu7) before class next week.
