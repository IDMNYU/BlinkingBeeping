* Assignments
  * Observation Project - Pick a piece of interactive technology (thinking back to the Crawford readings, you can articulate how interactive something is) used by multiple people in public. A phone/laptop/tablet/etc doesn't count because it's only used by one person at a time. Write down your assumptions as to how it's used, and describe the context in which it's being used. Watch people use it without them knowing they're being observed. Take notes on how they use it, what each person does differently, where there appear to be difficulties, and what appears to be easier parts. Record what takes the longest, what takes the least amount of time, and how long the whole transaction takes. Write the report in your blog.
  * Reading [How to use a digital oscilloscope](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-an-oscilloscope/all)
  * Midterm review survey - [fill out this questionnaire](https://forms.gle/ZXGxDvrupSSL5oVu7) before class next week.
