# Week 2 - Friday September 13
## THE PLAN
* Review DIY switches
* Demo presentation - the 555 timer
* circuit schematics ctd
  * Reading a datasheet
* [Toy Organ on a breadboard](toyOrgan/main.md)
* solder demo 
* Read  _due Septmber 20 before class starts_
  * 555 Timer from Make Electronics - distributed in Slack 
  * OPTIONAL - [Working with Wire](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire)
  * OPTIONAL - [How to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)
  * OPTIONAL- [Forrest Mims Engineer Mini Notebook - the 555 IC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3dOh7MKPkySFT6H7UyY9sOtodHpRk52/view?usp=sharing)
* Make _due Septmber 20 before class starts_
  * Build the rest of your [Toy Organ](toyOrgan/main.md) with your partner. Take video of it working and post it to youtube/vimeo/nyu stream and embed it on your class journal
  * replace the switches on the breadboard with ones you have made. Docuemnt this and post it on your classs journal
  * Try different resistors, capacitors, or variable resistors in the circuit to generate different tones. Find anything you like?
  * Extra credit - build one of the basic monstable or astable circuits from the [Forrest Mims 555 book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3dOh7MKPkySFT6H7UyY9sOtodHpRk52/view?usp=sharing) and post it to your journal. 
* Watch  _due Septmber 20 before class starts_
