# Week 2 - Monday September 11 & Wednesday September 13
## Monday
* Interaction
* the breadboard
* circuit schematics
* ICs & the 555 timer
  * Asatble, monstable, bistable
* [The APC on a breadboard](apc.md)
* Read
  * 555 Timer from Make Electronics - distributed in Slack 
  * OPTIONAL - [Working with Wire](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire)
  * OPTIONAL - [How to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)
  * OPTIONAL- [Forrest Mims Engineer Mini Notebook - the 555 IC](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3dOh7MKPkySFT6H7UyY9sOtodHpRk52/view?usp=sharing)
* Make (for class on Wed)
  * Build the rest of your [Atari Punk Console](apc.md). If you have access to different resistors, capacitors, or variable resistors, try using them in the circuit to generate different sounds. 
* Watch

## Wednesday
* Reading a datasheet
* Experimenting with different sensors in the circuit
* how the 555 works
* solder demo 
* Watch
  * [Soldering Crash Course: Basic Techniques, Tips and Advice!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rmErwU5E-k)
* Read
  * [How to read a datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/tutorials/223)
* Take the [online training and quiz](https://wp.nyu.edu/idmtech/) to use the soldering irons in the IDM Design Lab
* Make
  * [Solder your circuit onto a perfboard](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8018678). Put it inside an enclosure of some kind. Document this and put it on your blog. Why did you choose this enclosure? did you make any modifications to the circuit? What were they?
