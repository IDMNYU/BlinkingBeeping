# Final Project

For your final, you are to demonstrate a fully physically interactive system that keeps a user engaged. You may work on your own or in groups of 2 for this project. You are expected to keep notes every week as you progress.  

You should be able to draw on the skills we covered in class and show off what you can do. This includes but is not limited to serial communication between a computer and a microcontroller, physical interaction design (ex. is the interface understandable, is there a mapping between the interface and the system, is it repeatable, etc etc ),and physical construction (are the wires and electonics hidden from view, does it collapse when it is used, etc.).

You will have milestones each week to document and describe. 
* Project summary - what is the idea for your system, what does it do? - _Due Friday Nov 15_
  * include sketches, imnages, prior examples and inspirations. Create a narrative and imaging acting it out (actually act it out in class too, you're all good with this). Your project description should be at least 200 words, and you need to include multiple shetches, renderings, and inages for what you propose to make.  
* BOM - what are the materials you need, what is the knowledge you need - _Due Fri Nov 22_
* beta version of the system due. Basic functionality and a prototype must be ready - _Due Fri Dec 6_
* final project and documentation due - _Due Wed Dec 11_

Document your work thoroughly online as you go. Include details of all phases of the project.

Various project ideas

* Musical Instruments - create an interfave for a musical instrument on your computer.
* Controller - a music, video, performance, gestrure, or game controller. 
* Sensor Visualization - create a system that changes over time based on the sensor input (long term art isntallation) 
* interactive objects - think of a physical artifact that lives in the world and is resaponsive to external stimuli 
* networked devices - interactive objects that can communicate with one another
