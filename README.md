### **Welcome to Blinking Beeping Moving Sensing!**

This course is an intorductory course in physical computing, with a emphasis on unusual physical interaction- that is, input and output. We'll use microcontrollers, lights, speakers, buttons, sensors, and actuators like motors to physicalize digital processes, not just push a bunch of pixels on screen.  

### **COURSE GOALS**
In this course, students will :

- develop **conceptual thinking** skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
- develop **technical** skills with microcontrollers to realize their ideas.
- develop **critical thinking** skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
- gain **knowledge of professional practices** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation.
- develop **collaboration** skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### **LEARNING OUTCOMES**

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a project that incorporates microcontrollers, electricity, physical inputs, and physical outputs.

### **COURSE STRUCTURE**

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations.

This class will consist of

* Workshop style projects in class
* Group Discussion
* In-class Peer Critiques
* Project Presentations and Critique

##### Required Reading
All readings will be provided as PDFs or online links.

##### Required Hardware
You may wind up spending money on this course for sensors, actuators, equipment, etc. Always discuss your intentions with the instructor before purchasing anything.

You'll have access to the majorit of things you will need, and there is a standard issue kit that you will have access to for the semester.

The IDM Design Lab will have a bunch of basics for you to work with : LEDs, wire, resistors, transistors, capacitors, etc. You are free to use these tools, but if you’re going to be building something of significant scope, you should get your own materials.

If you get really into prototyping with electronics, you can get some hand tools and other equipment, but again, it’s best to ask about what you need.

### **COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS**

* EMAIL ME - however if your email is more than a paragraph we should probably be meeting in person.
* Talk to me in person directly after class, come by office hours, or set up an appointment about issues and problems.

### **EVALUATION & GRADING**
You will keep a class journal. This will be your repository for research, thoughts and reactions to the readings, documentation of your projects, and a place for you to comment and critique each other’s work. 

You must document your work online with text, photos, sketches, code, videos, and audio files as approriate. This is not only for your weekly production assignments, but also process documentation for the midterm and final projects.

Students should expect to spend roughly 5 hours each week on supplemental work in this course. This may include reading assignments, writing, exam preparation, research, homework assignments, building, writing code, study time, unsupervised lab work, unsupervised group work, etc.

##### QUANTITATIVE GRADING OVERVIEW

blog posts about the readings |  10
weekly production assignments  | 15
research assignment and presentation | 5
midterm project  |  15
final project | 25
attendance | 15
class participation | 15
total |  100

##### QUALITATIVE GRADING OVERVIEW

- **A. Excellent \(90-100\)**
- **B. Very Good / Good \(80-89\)**
- **C. Satisfactory \(70-79\)**
- **D. Poor; Below Average \(60-69\)**
- **F. Unacceptable \(59 & Below\)**

##### **Attendance and Assignments**

* Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One unexcused absence is allowed; after that, your final numerical grade will drop by 5 percent for each additional absence.
* Three or more unexcused absences will result in your failure in the class.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 10 minutes of tardiness, your final numerical grade will drop by 1 percent. 
* Contact the professor at least 24h in advance by email if you will not be in class. 
* absence to observe religious holidays will not be penalized, however the students should give prior notice as described above. 
* if you miss class because of illness or personal issue, let me know immediately via email. **You must also submit documentation to Deanna Rayment at deanna.rayment@nyu.edu.** Until I receive notification from her, any absence will be considered unexcused. 
* Late assignments will be penalized by 1/2 grade for each day past due date. 

### **ACADEMIC HONESTY**

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](https://engineering.nyu.edu/campus-and-community/student-life/office-student-affairs/policies/student-code-conduct) in its entirety.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words, media, or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. This is not only for prose, but includes code- if you're using someone elses' code, it must be properly attributed int he comments. This includes acknowledging the original author (if known) and where to code was found.

### **ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS**
If you are a student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or [mosescsd@nyu.edu](mailto:mosescsd@nyu.edu). You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations. Information about the Moses Center can be found at [http://www.nyu.edu/csd](http://www.nyu.edu/csd). The Moses Center is located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor.

If you are experiencing an illness or any other situation that might affect your academic performance in a class, please email the Office of Advocacy, Compliance and Student Affairs: [eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu](mailto:eng.studentadvocate@nyu.edu).

### **STATEMENT ON INCLUSION**
The NYU Tandon School values an inclusive and equitable environment for all our students. I hope to foster a sense of community in this class and consider it a place where individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, national origins, gender identities, sexual orientations, religious and political affiliations, and abilities will be treated with respect.  It is my intent that all students’ learning needs be addressed, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.  If this standard is not being upheld, please feel free to speak with me.
