## **Welcome to Blinking Beeping Moving Sensing !**

This course is an intorductory course in physical computing, with a emphasis on unusual physical interaction- that is, input and putput. We'll use microcontrollers, lights, speakers, buttons, sensors, and actuators like motors to physicalize digital processes, not just push a bunch of pixels on screen.  

### **COURSE GOALS**
In this course, students will :

- develop **conceptual thinking** skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
- develop **technical** skills with microcontrollers to realize their ideas.
- develop **critical thinking** skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
- gain **knowledge of professional practices** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation.
- develop **collaboration** skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### **LEARNING OUTCOMES**

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a project that incorporates microcontrollers, electricity, physical inputs, and physical outputs.

### **COURSE STRUCTURE**

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations.

This class will consist of

* Workshops
* Group Discussion
* In-class Peer Critiques
* Project Presentations and Critique

### **COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS**

* EMAIL ME - however if your email is more than a paragraph we should probably be meeting in person.
* Talk to me in person directly after class, come by office hours \(Wed 3:30-5pm\), or set up an appointment about issues and problems.

* Three or more unexcused absences will result in your failure in the class.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 10 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.5 percent. 
* Contact the professor at least 24h in advance by email if you will not be in class. 
* absence to observe religious holidays will not be penalized, however the students should give prior notice as described above. 
* if you miss class because of illness or personal issue, let me know immediately via email. **You must submit documentation to Deanna Rayment at deanna.rayment@nyu.edu.** Until I receive notification from her, your absense will be considered unexcused. 
* Late assignments will be penalized by 1/2 grade point for each day past due date. 

### **ACADEMIC HONESTY**

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/code-of-conduct/academic-dishonesty) in its entirety.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words, media, or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. Any student who commits plagiarism must re-do the assignment for a grade no higher than a D. D is also the highest possible course grade for any student who commits plagiarism. Please use the MLA or Chicago Manual of Style for citing and documenting source material.

You MUST have complete rights of use to any and all materials which appear in your thesis project. This includes images, illustrations, audio etc. The source of any materials NOT created by you MUST be properly cited. Please remember that you can collaborate with other students to create your own media or contact the authors of your media selections for rights. I strongly encourage you to use original media for your thesis project, however should you absolutely require to use stock images, video, etc., you will need to provide a PDF of all source files and the usage rights you have purchased/negotiated or whether it is creative commons or copyright free.
