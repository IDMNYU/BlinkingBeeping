### **Welcome to Blinking Beeping Moving Sensing!**

This course is an intorductory course in physical computing, with a emphasis on unusual physical interaction- that is, input and output. We'll use microcontrollers, lights, speakers, buttons, sensors, and actuators like motors to physicalize digital processes, not just push a bunch of pixels on screen.  

### **COURSE GOALS**
In this course, students will :

- develop **conceptual thinking** skills to generate ideas and content in order to solve problems or create opportunities.
- develop **technical** skills with microcontrollers to realize their ideas.
- develop **critical thinking** skills that will allow them to analyze and position their work within cultural, historic, aesthetic, economic, and technological contexts.
- gain **knowledge of professional practices** by developing their verbal, visual, and written communication for documentation and presentation.
- develop **collaboration** skills to actively and effectively work in a team or group.

### **LEARNING OUTCOMES**

By the end of the course, students will be able to develop, complete, and document a project that incorporates microcontrollers, electricity, physical inputs, and physical outputs.

### **COURSE STRUCTURE**

Students are expected to be on time for all meetings, critiques, and presentations.

This class will consist of

* Workshops
* Group Discussion
* In-class Peer Critiques
* Project Presentations and Critique

##### Required Reading
All readings will be provided as PDFs or online links.

##### Required Hardware
You need to have, at minimum, the following items before class on Feb 7:
* [half-size breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/64) $5.00
* [microcontroller](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/nano-every-with-headers) The Arduino Nano Every has all the functionality you need. If you already have a microcontoller you'd like to use, it's probably fine, but please check with me first. There are other boards that have other capabilities (wireless connections, built-in sensors, etc.), if you're curious, please ask and I can help you figure out what is best. $11.90
* [USB cable](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592) The Arduino Nano Every uses a USB micro connector. If you're using a different board, get the USB cable that's appropriate. This is for powering and programming your board. $2.95
* [Male to Male wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/153) These are great for quickly prototyping.

You may wind up spending money on this course for sensors, actuators, equipment, etc. Always discuss your intentions with the instructor before purchasing anything.

The IDM Proto Lab will have a bunch of basics for you to work with : LEDs, wire, resistors, transistors, capacitors, etc. You are free to use these tools, but if you’re going to be building something of significant scope, you should get your own materials.

If you get really into prototyping with electronics, you can get some hand tools and other equipment, but again, it’s best to ask about what you need.

### **COMMUNICATING WITH THE PROFESSOR OUTSIDE OF CLASS**

* EMAIL ME - however if your email is more than a paragraph we should probably be meeting in person.
* Talk to me in person directly after class, come by office hours \(Wed 3:30-5pm\), or set up an appointment about issues and problems.

### **EVALUATION & GRADING**
you are expected to keep a class journal on our wiki. This will be your repository for research, thoughts and reactions to the readings, documentation of your projects, and a place for you to comment and critique each other’s work. 

You must dicument your work online with text, photos, sketches, code, videos, and audio files as approriate. This is not only for your weekly production assignments, but also process documentation for the midterm and final projects.

##### QUANTITATIVE GRADING OVERVIEW

blog posts about the readings |  12
weekly production assignments  | 15
research assignment and presentation | 10
midterm project  |  15
final project | 25
attendance | 13
class participation | 10
total |  100

##### QUALITATIVE GRADING OVERVIEW

- **A. Excellent \(90-100\)**
- **B. Very Good / Good \(80-89\)**
- **C. Satisfactory \(70-79\)**
- **D. Poor; Below Average \(60-69\)**
- **F. Unacceptable \(59 & Below\)**

##### **Attendance and Assignments**

* Attendance is mandatory. Unexcused absences will affect your grade. One unexcused absence is allowed; after that, your final, overall, numerical grade will drop by 5 percent for each additional absence.
* Three or more unexcused absences will result in your failure in the class.
* Be on Time. Tardiness will affect your grade. For every 10 minutes of tardiness, your final, numerical grade will drop by 0.5 percent. 
* Contact the professor at least 24h in advance by email if you will not be in class. 
* absence to observe religious holidays will not be penalized, however the students should give prior notice as described above. 
* if you miss class because of illness or personal issue, let me know immediately via email. **You must also submit documentation to Deanna Rayment at deanna.rayment@nyu.edu.** Until I receive notification from her, any absence will be considered unexcused. 
* Late assignments will be penalized by 1/2 grade point for each day past due date. 

### **ACADEMIC HONESTY**

Please review [NYU's School of Engineering's academic dishonesty policy](https://engineering.nyu.edu/campus-and-community/student-life/office-student-affairs/policies/student-code-conduct) in its entirety.

All work for this class must be your own and specific to this semester. Any work recycled from other classes or from another, non-original source will be rejected with serious implications for the student. Plagiarism, knowingly representing the words, media, or ideas of another as one’s own work in any academic exercise, is absolutely unacceptable. This is not only for prose, but includes code- if you're using someone elses' code, it must be properly attributed int he comments. This includes acknowledging the original author (if known) and where to code was found.

### **ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS**

If you are student with a disability who is requesting accommodations, please contact New York University’s Moses Center for Students with Disabilities at 212-998-4980 or mosescsd@nyu.edu. You must be registered with CSD to receive accommodations. Information about the Moses Center can be found at http://www.nyu.edu/csd. The Moses Center is located at 726 Broadway on the 2nd floor.
