# Electronic Cheat Sheet

## Electricity Basics
* Electricity is the flow of negatively charged electrons through a given material (usually copper wire or another conductor). We use this natural phenomenon to power a variety of devices and circuits.
* Electricity can be harnessed and converted, used to create light or motion, to transfer data and communicate between systems.

## AC / DC
* AC – Alternating Current
   * Current oscillates.
   * fantastic for long distances/ high voltage / current applications
   * Supplied from the electricity grid through wall outlets.
     * In the US, AC is rated at 110/120 volts, and 60 Hertz
     * In the UK, EU and other countries, it’s rated at 220/240 volts at 50Hz
     * A list of all variations can be found here : https://www.school-for-champions.com/science/ac_world_volt_freq_list.htm
   * Used to electrocute elephants

* DC – Direct Current
   * Current flows in one direction.
   * Typically the end of the line
   * Most commonly found in day-to-day objects: battery powered tools, handheld and consumer electronics.

* Some devices — incandescent light bulbs, certain motors, heating elements — operate directly from AC current. Others (like many consumer electronics) accept AC current but translate it internally into DC current. Still others can only accept DC current.

## Ohms Law
* V=IR — The foundational equation for how to calculate the different properties of a circuit: voltage, current, and resistance.  
  * Voltage is the difference in charge between two points.
  * Current is the rate at which charge is flowing.
  * Resistance is a material’s capacity to resist the flow of charge (current).

* Ohms Law is relevant when building a circuit, but also when troubleshooting a circuit. For example:  identifying whether the voltage being supplied to a circuit is being used in its entirety and/or if any excess is being absorbed by the appropriate resistors.

## What is a circuit?
* Circuits are closed loops that allow electricity to flow from a point of higher potential energy, such as a the positive lead on a battery, to a lower potential, through a load like a lightbulb.
* They control the movement of electricity in service of a specific purpose or outcome through assemblies of electrical components.
* The key components of safe and effective circuitry include:
  * Understanding how to make sure that power flows correctly (and in its entirety) from an electrical source/power supply to a chosen output like a lightbulb or sound device.
  * The necessity that circuits be complete (closed) in order to function.
  * Understanding what causes short circuits and how to avoid them.
* Three things to remember about circuits
  * All voltage is used in a circuit
  * Electricity will follow the path of least resistance
  * The amount of current flowing into a spot in a circuit is the same that flows out

## Power vs Signal
* Electricity can be used to power a device or to create a signal. Examples of a power: to run a motor, turn on a lightbulb, etc.)
  * a signal is a method of communication between devices, for example between 2 integrated circuits
* Circuits created for these different purposes share many things in common, but also have unique requirements. When creating a signal, elements like frequency and noise become important. Different materials may be used to construct (and different tools may be used to test) a power circuit as opposed to a signal circuit.

## Power Supplies
* The source of electricity for your device/installation
* Could be batteries, wall worts, solar, wind, electro-magnetic in origin
* power for work could be either AC or DC
* Power supplies come in great variety and it is essential to identify the appropriate supply for a specific device.
* Key Components of a power supply:
  * Voltage and Current
  * AC/DC
  * Polarity

## Polarity
* Polarity indicates whether a circuit component is symmetric or not. A non-polarized (symmetric) component can be connected in any direction and still function the way it’s supposed to function. A polarized component can only be connected to a circuit in one direction. If connected in the wrong orientation, at best it won’t work as intended. At worst, it will smoke/spark/die.
* A common AA battery is a simple example of a polarized component: with positive and negative terminals that must be correctly aligned for it to function. Polarized elements in a circuit can be much more complicated though, with multiple connection points that each have a unique function and position.

## Tools of the Trade

  * A multimeter is multifunctional tool that can measure voltage, amperage, resistance, and continuity across a given component.

* [How to use an oscilloscope](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-an-oscilloscope)
  * An oscilloscope allows use to visualize the waveform of a given signal over time. We can use it to detect amplitude, frequency, and any potential inconsistencies.
  
* [Breadboarding](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)
  * Breadboards offer the opportunity to prototype a circuit before constructing it in a more permanent form.

* Components

* power supplies
  * These will provide power for the work. Typically plugged into a wall
* regulators
  * a type of component that drops voltage across its pins. the excess is released as heat. A 7805 regulator, will drop the voltage in a circuit to 5V
* [resistors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors)
  * resist the flow of electrical energy. Used to limit current and drop voltage.
  * measured in ohms, you can determine the amount of resistance with a multimeter, or using a [resistor color calculator](https://www.digikey.com/en/resources/conversion-calculators/conversion-calculator-resistor-color-code-4-band)
  * never polarized
* [capacitors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/capacitors)
  * components that store and discharge electricity over time. They are often used to smooth out irregularities in current and voltage.

  * steppers
  * brushless DC motor
  * solenoids
  * linear actuators that operate along the same principles as motors.
* relays
  * a relay uses an electromagnet to open or close a switch. They make really fun clicking noises and are often used to control high voltage/high current circuits from a smaller, safer one
* transistors
  * solid state switches used to amplify signals and power
* diodes
  * polarized components that make sure electricity only flows in one direction. useful in AC circuits, or in DC circuits when using an inductive load like a motor
* LEDs
  * the most fun diodes. they are polarized components that emit light when voltage is applied
* switches
  * used to control the flow of electricity in a circuit. There are many shapes, sizes and kinds. The small pushbutton ones we have are momentary, but there are also latched ones that work like a lightswitch in that they hold their position.
* [Series vs. Parallel circuits](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/series-and-parallel-circuits)
  * If components in a circuit are in series, there is only one path for current to flow through them.  
  * In parallel circuitry, current can take multiple paths between elements/components.
* [Schematics](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-read-a-schematic)
  * A Schematic is a map of how to properly connect a given circuit. Symbols represent various components (like resistors, capacitors, switches, ics, and power sources)  and lines represent connections between those components.
