# Week 3 - September 20
* Review the organs and switches
* [multimeters](https://learn.adafruit.com/multimeters/overview)
* [what is this board anyhow](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/)
 * [Read Ch 1, _A History of Interaction_ from "Where the Action is" by Paul Dourish](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5966349&ppg=14). Dourish writes about a history of embodied interaction. He defines two separate threads that lead to this: _social_ and _tangible_ computing. How do you understand these terms based on the reading? Do you agree with his definitions? Do you think there are other kinds of computing he is ignoring? Write about this in your class journal.
* [Arduino IDE, board definitions](week4.md)
* [Digital Out, what's the deal with all those pins anyhow?](/week4/week4.md)
* [Blink without delay](https://gist.github.com/shfitz/ebcdd885c6dba4117ea96217d6777b47)
* Assignment : use the switch that you built (or a new one you created) to control an LED on your breadboard with a microcontrller. Use digitalIn(), digitalOut(), and delay() to create different effects. How does this differ from controlling the LED directly as you did in week 1?
