# Week 3 - Monday September 18 & Wednesday September 20
## Monday
* Review the APCs
* [multimeters](https://learn.adafruit.com/multimeters/overview)
* [review of electricity](https://idmnyu.github.io/BlinkingBeeping/week1/notes.html)
  * [Ohm's law](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-current-resistance-and-ohms-law/all)
  * Voltage/Current/Amperage
  * [series v parallel circuits](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/series-and-parallel-circuits)
* **For Wednesday 9/20**
 * [Read Ch 1, _A History of Interaction_ from "Where the Action is" by Paul Dourish](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5966349&ppg=14). Dourish writes about a history of embodied interaction. He defines two separate threads that lead to this: _social_ and _tangible_ computing. How do you understand these terms based on the reading? Do you agree with his definitions? Do you think there are other kinds of computing he is ignoring? Write about this in your class journal.

## Wednesday
* distribute kits in class - [register your kit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eVxxaoraWHUMTKuCO0b_X3qMkFlgYVAzQqcpWimRemM/edit?usp=sharing)
* [what is this board anyhow](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/nano-33-ble)
* more series & parallel
* Read - [Everything you never wanted to know about switches](switches.md)
* [Adafruit's guide on different types of switches](https://learn.adafruit.com/make-it-switch?view=all)
* **For Monday 9/25**
  * [sign up for presentations in pairs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1puuSo1RRAAKl-aeUxbrdxXJVRRSkGrs7cjTO3wqOPdE/edit?usp=sharing)
  * On paper, sketch out an imagined switch that controls a system (represented by an LED turining on or off). Make a circuit that realizes this sketch. What does this indicate? How is the action of using the switch relate to the light turining on? Clearly document your switch with video and post the sketch and video on your class journal. Now do it again, building a totally differrent switch that indicates something else. Document this and post it to your site. Write a brief description of how each works, what the light signifies, and how the input relates to the output. Bring at least one of these switches to class. 
  * You may work in pairs on this project. If you do, make the same post on each documentation site.
