* **For Wednesday 9/20**
 * [Read Ch 1, _A History of Interaction_ from "Where the Action is" by Paul Dourish](https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.proxy.library.nyu.edu/lib/nyulibrary-ebooks/reader.action?docID=5966349&ppg=14). Dourish writes about a history of embodied interaction. He defines two separate threads that lead to this: _social_ and _tangible_ computing. How do you understand these terms based on the reading? Do you agree with his definitions? Do you think there are other kinds of computing he is ignoring? Write about this in your class journal.

## Wednesday
* distribute kits in class

* **For Monday 9/25**
  * (sign up for sensor presentations)
  * Make a circuit with a novel switch that turns on a light. What does this indicate? How is the action of using the switch relate to the light turining on? What does this indicate? Docuemtn your switch with video, post it on your class journal, and write up a brief description of how the input relates to the output. You may work in pairs on this project. Each person should write their own reflection.
